Manna
=====

Fixed energy Manna sandpile model Monte Carlo simulation.

Implements the basic 1D Manna model discussed in
http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.89.060101
using parallel updates.

Setting BOOSTPATH to point to a recent boost release (http://www.boost.org) and using the CMake file should be enough to compile the program.
